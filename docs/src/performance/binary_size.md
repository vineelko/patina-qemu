# Patina DXE Core Release Binary Composition and Size Optimizations

This document is a reference for the current set of size-related optimizations performed on the Patina DXE Core
release binary.

```admonish abstract title="TL;DR"
Summary of the current status of the QEMU DXE Core binary size, marking the logical conclusion of the size
optimization efforts:

1. Rust compiler size related optimizations (**Applied**)
2. Disabling logging can save an additional 150 KB (**Not Applied**)
3. Defaulting to UEFI decompression in the section extractor while skipping Brotli and CRC32 can save another 150 KB
   (**Not Applied**)
4. Excluding Patina debugger support saves another 55 KB (**Not Applied**)

Bringing the size from 1,162 KB to **406 KB** (a reduction of 65%). The details are documented below.
```

## 1. Common Rust Compiler Optimizations Focused on Reducing Binary Size

**Optimization Status:** Applied

```toml
[profile.release]
codegen-units = 1               # Default is 16; setting it to 1 prioritizes size over compilation speed.
debug = "full"
lto = true                      # Enables Link Time Optimization - significant size reduction.
opt-level = "s"                 # Optimize for size - significant size reduction.
split-debuginfo = "packed"
strip = "symbols"               # Remove symbol information from the final binary (not very relevant for PE files).
incremental = true
```

Below is the composition of the Patina DXE Core release binary for QEMU, located at
`target\x86_64-unknown-uefi\release\qemu_q35_dxe_core.efi`. This represents the final binary after applying the
non-destructive compiler optimizations outlined in
[PR #19](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina-dxe-core-qemu/pull/19):

| Segment       | Size on Disk |
| ------------- | -----------: |
| .text         |     495.0 KB |
| .rdata        |     249.5 KB |
| .data         |       3.0 KB |
| .pdata        |      11.0 KB |
| miscellaneous |       4.0 KB |
| **Total**     |   **762 KB** |

**Results:** **1,162 KB** down to **762 KB** (a reduction of approximately **35%**).

## 2. Logging: Reducing Binary Size by Disabling Logging

**Optimization Status:** Not Applied

The other substantial reduction in the release binary size is observed when logging is completely disabled, as shown
below in `\patina-dxe-core-qemu\Cargo.toml` using `release_max_level_off`.

```toml
[dependencies]
log = { version = "^0.4", default-features = false, features = ["release_max_level_off"] }
```

**Results:** **762 KB** to **599 KB** (a reduction of approximately **160 KB** (**21%**)).

## 3. Decompression: Reducing Binary Size by Defaulting to UEFI Decompression

**Optimization Status:** Not Applied

Defaulting to UEFI decompression in the section extractor while skipping Brotli and CRC32 can save another 140 KB.

```toml
[dependencies]
patina_section_extractor = { version = "4", registry = "patina-fw", default-features = false, features = ["uefi_decompress"] }
```

**Results:** **599 KB** to **460 KB** (a reduction of approximately **140 KB** (**23%**)).

## 4. Debugger: Reducing Binary Size by Excluding Debugger Support

**Optimization Status:** Not Applied

Excluding debugger support can save another 55 KB. This reduces the size from 460 KB to **~406 KB**.

```rust
// Commenting below lines will exclude debugger support
static DEBUGGER: patina_debugger::PatinaDebugger<Uart16550> =
    patina_debugger::PatinaDebugger::new(Uart16550::Io { base: 0x3F8 })
        .with_force_enable(false)
        .with_log_policy(patina_debugger::DebuggerLoggingPolicy::FullLogging);

    patina_debugger::set_debugger(&DEBUGGER);
```

```toml
[dependencies]
# Commenting below line will exclude debugger support
# patina_debugger = { version = "4", registry = "patina-fw" }
```

**Results:** **460 KB** to **406 KB** (a reduction of approximately **55 KB** (**11%**)).

## Project MU vs Patina FV Size Comparison

Up to this point, we have seen what constitutes the Rust DXE Core binary and how it can be optimized. This section
performs a platform image-level comparison between a C-based UEFI firmware image and a Rust-based Patina UEFI firmware
image. There are many components that differ between the C-based UEFI and the Rust-based UEFI images. Below is a
summary of the components that have been folded into the Rust DXE Core. On the left is the size represented by the
Project MU-based QEMU FV file (DxeCore, RuntimeDxe, CpuDxe), and on the right the size represented by the Patina FV
file (DxeCore).

| Module     |                     Mu |                 Patina |
| ---------- | ---------------------: | ---------------------: |
| DxeCore    |     0x2EC3E (188.0 KB) |     0x63430 (405.0 KB) |
| RuntimeDxe |        0x206E (8.1 KB) |                        |
| CpuDxe     |     0x19266 (100.2 KB) |                        |
| **TOTAL**  | **0x49F12 (296.3 KB)** | **0x63430 (405.0 KB)** |

The Rust binary includes the following additional features that are not available in the C-based UEFI image, with a
size increase of approximately 110 KB compared to the C-based image:

- Functionality that is typically split across multiple EFI binaries (DxeCore, RuntimeDxe, CpuDxe) in C-based
  implementations.
- Advanced features such as built-in source-level debugging capabilities.
- Two dispatchers: pure Rust component dispatch and FFS dispatch.
- Stringent memory protection features not present in most C-based DXE Core implementations.
